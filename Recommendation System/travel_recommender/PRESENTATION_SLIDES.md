## Slide 1: Introduction to Recommendation Systems

### What are Recommendation Systems?
• **Smart suggestion engines** that predict what users might like based on data
• **Used everywhere** - Netflix movies, Amazon products, Spotify music, Instagram posts
• **Solve information overload** - help users find relevant content from millions of options
• **Increase user engagement** - keep users interested and active on platforms
• **Business value** - improve user satisfaction and platform retention rates

## Slide 2: Types of Recommendation Systems & Our Choice

### Three Main Types:
• **Collaborative Filtering** - "Users like you also liked..." (finds similar users)
• **Content-Based** - "Since you liked X, try Y..." (analyzes item features)  
• **Hybrid Systems** - Combines both approaches for better accuracy

### Why We Chose Hybrid Approach:
• **Best of both worlds** - social proof + content relevance
• **Handles cold start** - works for new users and new travel posts
• **More accurate** - 60% collaborative + 40% content-based weighting
